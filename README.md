# LabManager

Every laboratory should be able to track its inventory easily and efficiently. Yet, many labs still use hand-written logs or Excel workbooks because of the cost that an inventory system (or addition to their current LIMS) would incur. LabManager was created to help laboratories track the details of their inventory in a convenient and efficient manner without dramatically increasing overhead costs due to software expenses.
